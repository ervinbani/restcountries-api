## API Integration

This project uses the [REST Countries API v3.1](https://restcountries.com/) to fetch comprehensive country data.

### Endpoints Used:

- `GET /v3.1/all?fields=name,population,region,capital,flags` - Fetch all countries with specific fields
- `GET /v3.1/name/{name}` - Search countries by name (partial match)
- `GET /v3.1/name/{name}?fullText=true` - Get country by exact name match (returns all fields)

### API Service Architecture:

The project implements a clean separation between the API layer and business logic:

```typescript
// ApiService - Low-level HTTP communication
class ApiService {
  static async getAllCountries(params?: string): Promise<any[]>;
  static async getCountryByName(name: string): Promise<any[]>;
  static async getCountryByFullName(name: string): Promise<any>;
}

// Country Model - Business logic and data transformation
class Country {
  static async fetchAllCountries(): Promise<Country[]>;
  static async searchCountries(query: string): Promise<Country[]>;
  static async fetchCountryByFullName(name: string): Promise<Country>;
}
```

### Error Handling:

- **Network Errors**: Detected and displayed with user-friendly messages
- **404 Errors**: Handled for countries not found
- **Status Code Errors**: Generic error handling for other HTTP errors
- **Loading States**: Spinner animations during data fetching
- **Retry Functionality**: "Try Again" button on error states

## Development Reflection

### Development Process

Building this REST Countries API application was an enriching journey that reinforced many modern web development concepts. I started with setting up a TypeScript environment, which initially posed challenges with module configuration. The `verbatimModuleSyntax` error taught me the importance of understanding ES modules vs CommonJS, leading to a proper configuration with `"type": "module"` in package.json.

The API integration phase was straightforward thanks to TypeScript's type safety, which caught potential errors early. Implementing pagination was crucial—displaying 250+ countries at once caused performance issues, so breaking them into 25 per page significantly improved user experience and load times.

### Challenges Faced

#### 1. TypeScript Module Configuration

**Challenge**: Encountered `verbatimModuleSyntax` error when using CommonJS modules.  
**Solution**: Converted to ES modules by adding `"type": "module"` to package.json and configuring TypeScript with `"module": "nodenext"`.

#### 2. Accessibility Implementation

One of the biggest challenges was achieving comprehensive accessibility. Initially, my accessibility score was around 60/100. Through research and implementation of ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, skip links, and screen reader support, I elevated it to 90+. This taught me that accessibility isn't an afterthought but an integral part of development that should be considered from the start.

#### 3. Performance Optimization

**Challenge**: Rendering 250+ countries caused sluggish performance.  
**Solution**: Implemented pagination system showing 25 countries per page with intuitive navigation controls, significantly improving rendering speed and user experience.

#### 4. Dark Mode Persistence

The dark mode feature with localStorage persistence was particularly satisfying to implement. Watching the theme smoothly transition and persist across sessions showcased the power of CSS custom properties combined with JavaScript state management.

#### 5. Error Handling

Error handling presented interesting scenarios—network failures, 404 errors, and loading states all needed user-friendly feedback. Implementing retry functionality made the app more resilient and user-centric, ensuring users aren't left stranded when API calls fail.

### Solutions Implemented

- **Clean Architecture**: Separated concerns with Model-Service-View pattern
- **Type Safety**: Leveraged TypeScript for robust, maintainable code
- **SCSS Variables**: Used CSS custom properties for dynamic theming
- **API Service Layer**: Abstracted HTTP calls with comprehensive error handling
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility with visible focus indicators
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during asynchronous operations

### Technical Learnings

1. **TypeScript Class-based Architecture**: Organizing code with OOP principles improved maintainability
2. **CSS Custom Properties**: Dynamic theme switching without JavaScript DOM manipulation
3. **LocalStorage API**: Persisting user preferences across sessions
4. **REST API Integration**: Efficient field filtering and data transformation
5. **ARIA Attributes**: Proper use of roles, labels, and live regions for accessibility
6. **Git Best Practices**: Atomic commits with descriptive messages

### Conclusion

This project solidified my understanding of TypeScript, modern CSS with SCSS, API integration patterns, and the critical importance of accessibility in web applications. The combination of strong typing, clean architecture, and user-centric design resulted in a robust, maintainable application. Most importantly, I learned that building accessible, performant applications requires intentional planning and continuous refinement throughout the development process.

The experience of taking a project from initial setup through deployment, while solving real challenges along the way, has been invaluable for my growth as a developer. I'm proud of the final result and the lessons learned throughout this journey.

If I were to continue development, I'd focus on converting border country codes to clickable names, adding offline support with service workers, implementing a comparison feature, and adding unit tests for better code reliability.

## Future Improvements

- [ ] **Advanced Filters**: Multiple simultaneous filters (population range, language, currency)
- [ ] **Favorites System**: Save favorite countries with localStorage persistence
- [ ] **Comparison Feature**: Side-by-side comparison of multiple countries
- [ ] **Maps Integration**: Interactive maps showing country locations using Leaflet or Google Maps
- [ ] **Export Functionality**: Download country data as CSV or JSON
- [ ] **Offline Support**: Service workers for offline functionality and caching
- [ ] **Internationalization (i18n)**: Multi-language support for global users
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Jest/Vitest for testing components and API services
- [ ] **Animation Enhancements**: Smooth page transitions and micro-interactions
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Lazy loading images and virtual scrolling
- [ ] **PWA Features**: Make the app installable as a Progressive Web App
